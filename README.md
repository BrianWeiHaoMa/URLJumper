# URLJumper
A chrome extension that allows mapping `name URL` pairs as search shortcuts.
By default, `Alt+M` opens the extension for redirecting the current window and `Alt+N` opens the
extension for URL jumping onto a new tab. Typing `name` in the popup text box and entering will take
you to `URL`. `name URL` pairs can be set in the settings page. You can also write comments along 
with your `name URL` pairs by using \\ (a backslash).

## Use cases
- You have an IP address URL that you want to connect to: "movies http://192.168.1.136:8083"
- You want to use generic and short names: "benefits https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html"

The mappings will look like:
```
movies http://192.168.1.136:8083 \ I can write comments like this
benefits https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html
```
