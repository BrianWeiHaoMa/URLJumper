# URLJumper
A chrome extension that allows mapping "name URL" pairs as search shortcuts.
By default, Alt+M opens the extension for redirecting the current window and Alt+N opens the
extension for URL jumping on a new tab. Typing "name" in the text box and entering will take
you to "URL".

## Use cases
- You have an IP address URL that you want to connect to: "movies http://192.168.1.136:8083"
- You want to use generic and short names: "benefits https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html"
